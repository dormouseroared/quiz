      "Over-modulation on AM and SSB, or over-deviation on FM, can cause harmonics of the AUDIO frequencies, so a normal Audio Frequency (AF) bandwidth of 3kHz can become 6-9kHz or more, so AF occupies a wider bandwidth (potential to stray into an adjacent channel and cause UNDUE interference) and sounds distorted, and the RF created will also have excessive bandwidth, flat-topping and extra sidebands (FM). To prevent this problem, use the microphone gain control (or speak more quietly) to keep AM modulation below 100% (80% is recommended) and keep FM deviation within limits.",

The weakest signal is the Minimal Discernable Signal, and it can be detected over the INTERNAL NOISE from the design of the receiver. The Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) is used for comparison, the lower the microVolts for 10dB SNR, is the more sensitive. The less voltage in for the same output if comparing two receivers. External noise will also affect reception, from equipment with poor EMC compliance, Galactic Noise, etc. All the noise sources add to the Noise Floor. To combat this, Yagi or dish antennas can be used. Also, external noise can be filtered out using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) or Noise cancelling devices.",

On DECAY or RELEASE, which can be from 25mS (fast) to 1s (slow) the AGC will return to normal.
