The weakest signal is the Minimal Discernable Signal, and it can be detected over the INTERNAL NOISE from the design of the receiver. The Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) is used for comparison, the lower the microVolts for 10dB SNR, is the more sensitive. The less voltage in for the same output if comparing two receivers. External noise will also affect reception, from equipment with poor EMC compliance, Galactic Noise, etc. All the noise sources add to the Noise Floor. To combat this, Yagi or dish antennas can be used. Also, external noise can be filtered out using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) or Noise cancelling devices.",

      "It is an odd concept, but does have some use, because it deals with POWER. It compares the forward power with the returned power. In an ideal system, all the power goes up the feeder, and is radiated by the antenna. So in a perfect match, all RF power is radiated, or absorbed by the load as heat in the case of rubbish coax. So a perfect SWR has zero power returned (or reflected) and in RL terms that is a high loss from the system, a HIGH RL. Remember that the magnitude of RL is the opposite of the magnitude of SWR. So in an ideal system we maximise FORWARD POWER and minimise RETURNED POWER, and that will mean a high RL. Best to think of it as just RL, and don't use the confusing words. Incident === Forward & Returned = Reflected. There are some calculation examples. With the Casio clone calculator, I used shift-DEL to toggle insert and overwrite mode when pressing REPLAY to edit a formula when I forgot to use brackets. REPLAY is also useful to check that a calculation has been entered correctly.",

It is the AMU circuit which consists of inductors and resistors: (1) the T-match, consisting of two variable capacitors and a variable inductor, but it is also acting as a high pass filter, so any harmonics present will be carried forward. Another downside is the potential for an excess of heat loss. (2) the pi-match, forms a low pass filter, suppressing harmonics, with a variable inductor and two variable capacitors. (3) L-match, one variable inductor and one variable capacitor, with lower losses but limited frequency coverage.",

      "Blocking can block sound, or vision, or both, so a wanted broadcast signal just gets wiped out. The cause is likely to be a MODE that has a constant amplitude e.g. FM, or a data mode like FT8 or RTTY. The strong amateur signal overloads the receiver (RF amplifier), goes non-linear with harmonics and intermodulation products, swamping the next stage (Intermediate Frequency): then the AGC kicks in and reduces the gain of the incoming signal... When it occurs, it is total! Cross-modulation is similar, but involves a mode where the amplitude is changing (SSB, CW, etc) and the incoming wanted signal comes and goes with distortion and the amateur voice breaking through.",

      "Main focus here is problems in reception. See Transmitter Interference for issues when transmitting. More likely to have problems with an increase in power. Only use the minimum power required to make the contact. This implies reducing field strength by increasing distance from antenna and/or reducing power. Some examples of calculating EX309 Field Strength (E), where ERP is power at feedpoint x antenna gain, and the key question: is it better to halve your power, or double the distance from your antenna? RF earthing for certain antennas can be problematic (a very serious mains safety issue) if house has PME earthing. There can also be problems with RF earthing in an upstairs shack, due to the length of the RF earth wire and its potential to radiate when transmitting. Antenna systems can also be chosen that do not need an RF earth. Balanced antennas tend to cause fewer EMC problems than unbalanced antennas especially when a balanced twin feeder is used to connect the balanced antenna to ground level at 90 degrees where it could be connected to a balun and then a buried coaxial cable, with earth rods (with a PME earth, these should be avoided unless professional advice is sought). See Fig 13.8 in the manual for an EMC friendly HF antenna with balanced line and coaxial feeder.",
