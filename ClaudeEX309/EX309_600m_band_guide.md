# 600m Band (472-479 kHz) - Simplified Guide

## Basic Information

- **Frequency Range**: 472-479 kHz (600 meters)
- **License Level**: Full License only
- **Maximum Power**: 5 Watts EIRP
- **Service Status**: Secondary (must not interfere with primary services)

## Frequency Usage Plan

| Frequency Range | Bandwidth  | Permitted Modes    | Notes          |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 472-475 kHz     | 200 Hz max | CW only            | Note 1 applies |
| 475-479 kHz     | 500 Hz max | CW & Digital modes | Note 1 applies |

## Key Terms Explained

| Abbreviation/Term          | Full Meaning                            | Explanation                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **EIRP**                   | Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power | The actual power radiated by your antenna system |
| **Secondary User**         | Lower priority allocation               | You must not cause interference to primary users |
| **CW**                     | Continuous Wave                         | Morse code transmission                          |
| **Digimodes**              | Digital Modes                           | Computer-based modes like PSK31, RTTY, etc.      |
| **QRSS**                   | Slow-speed CW                           | Very slow morse code for weak signal work        |
| **Non-interference basis** | No protection from interference         | You can't complain if others interfere with you  |
| **NGR**                    | National Grid Reference                 | UK map coordinate system                         |

## Important Restrictions (Note 2)

### Geographic Restrictions

Some countries **completely prohibit** amateur use of 472-479 kHz, including:

- Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, China
- Egypt, UAE, Russia, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait
- Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Oman, Uzbekistan, Qatar
- Syria, Kyrgyzstan, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen

### What This Means

- These countries use this band for maritime and aviation navigation
- UK amateurs should be aware when working stations from these regions
- Some overseas stations may have transmit restrictions to avoid interfering with navigation beacons

## Practical Operating Guidelines

### Power Limits

- **Maximum**: 5 watts EIRP (not ERP - this is important!)
- Much lower than other HF bands
- Requires efficient antenna systems

### Bandwidth Limits

- **472-475 kHz**: Maximum 200 Hz (CW only)
- **475-479 kHz**: Maximum 500 Hz (CW and digital modes)
- These are **necessary bandwidth** limits - stay well within them

### Mode Recommendations

- **CW**: Traditional morse code
- **QRSS**: Very slow CW for long-distance weak signal work
- **Digital**: PSK31, RTTY, and similar narrow-band modes
- **No voice modes** permitted

## Exam Tips

- Remember this band requires Full License (not Intermediate/Foundation)
- Power is in **EIRP**, not ERP
- Bandwidth limits are strict
- Secondary status means no interference protection
- Some countries completely prohibit amateur use
