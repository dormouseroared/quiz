> I'm using Mathjax with html, js, etc to display maths in a quiz app. Because I'm dynamically generating html using js into the DOM, I have to trigger mathjax to interpret the syntax. I noticed that part of the syllabusItems was not displaying correctly, and it turns out that this element does not have a MathJax typeset trigger.

In this example, some dynamic HTML has been created in `explanationDiv` that may or may not contain \$...\$ (inline) or \$\$...\$\$ (display) sequences, and immediately afterwards, the dynamic HTML is typeset by MathJax.

```js
// Trigger MathJax to typeset the newly injected content

if (window.MathJax?.typesetPromise) {
    MathJax.typesetPromise([explanationDiv]).catch((err) =>
        console.error("MathJax typeset error:", err),
    )
}
```

Looking through `index.js` shows that this routine is, or could be, manually added and adapted to each HTML element in these places:

- `explanationDiv` when the `Explanation Button` is clicked after a question has been answered, and the eventListener is invoked **status: completed**

- `btn` for each of the four multiple choice answers to each question in the function `loadQuestion` which runs initially as part of the response to the search button selecting some questions, and then every time the `Next Question` button is clicked **status: completed**
- `syllabusItemsDiv` and `questionDiv` **status: work in progress** are both loaded in loadQuestion function

To correctly trigger MathJax to process dynamically added content, you need to use the MathJax.typesetPromise() method and provide it with the specific DOM element you want it to process. This prevents MathJax from re-rendering the entire page, which is more efficient.

Here is a complete, runnable HTML file that demonstrates this by creating and rendering a new section of content with MathJax syntax when a button is clicked.

The Complete HTML & JavaScript Code

The code includes a container (id="math-container") where new content will be injected and a button to trigger the process. The JavaScript handles the content generation and then calls MathJax.typesetPromise() on the newly created element.

> This time round I want to turn it into a function. Is it best to call the function like this: mathJaxUpdate(elementReference) and then in the code use the spread operator: [...elementReference] or some other way?

That's a good approach. Creating a function is definitely the best way to handle this. Using the spread operator ... on a single element is unnecessary since typesetPromise expects an array, but if you're dealing with a collection of elements, the spread operator would be ideal.

Let's make a clear, reusable function to handle this for you.

## The mathjaxUpdate Function

You can create a function that takes a single DOM element or an array-like collection of elements as an argument. The most robust way is to always ensure the argument is treated as an array.

Here's how you'd write the function:
JavaScript

```js
/\*\*

- Triggers MathJax to re-render a specific element or a collection of elements.

- @param {HTMLElement|NodeListOf<HTMLElement>} elements - The element(s) to process.
  \*/
  function mathJaxUpdate(elements) {
  // Ensure the input is an array-like object, then convert it to an array.
  const elementsToProcess = Array.isArray(elements) ? elements : [elements];

    if (window.MathJax?.typesetPromise) {

         // Pass the array of elements to MathJax for efficient processing.
         MathJax.typesetPromise(elementsToProcess).catch((err) =>
             console.error("MathJax typesetting error:", err)
         );

    } else {

         console.warn("MathJax is not loaded or ready.");

    }
    }
```

### How to Call the mathjaxUpdate function

You can call this function in a couple of ways, depending on what you're trying to re-render.

#### For a Single Element

If you just added a single new element to the page, like in the previous example, you would call the function with that element directly:

```JavaScript

const newDiv = document.createElement('div');
// ...add content and inject into DOM...
mathJaxUpdate(newDiv);
```

#### For a Collection of Elements

If you've added multiple elements, you could get them all at once and pass them to the function. For example, using querySelectorAll to get all new math-block divs, marked with the class of `math-block`:

```JavaScript

const newBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('.math-block');
mathJaxUpdate(newBlocks);
```

This approach is efficient because typesetPromise will render all the passed elements in a single batch, rather than re-rendering the whole page. The [...elementsToProcess] you mentioned is a good pattern if your function isn't already converting the input to an array. However, by handling the conversion inside the function, you make the function call simpler and more flexible.

> if I had elements div1,div2,div3 how would I use the routine: like this?

```js
mathJaxUpdate([div1, div2, div3])
```

Yes, that is exactly how you would use the routine.

The function mathjaxUpdate is designed to accept an array of elements. By passing [div1, div2, div3], you are providing an array of the specific DOM elements you want MathJax to process. This is the most efficient and correct way to use the function for multiple elements.

Here's a quick breakdown of why this works:

    The Function's Design: The mathJaxUpdate function you provided is written to handle its input gracefully. The line const elementsToProcess = Array.isArray(elements) ? elements : [elements]; ensures that the function always works with an array, whether you give it a single element or a group.

    The typesetPromise Method: The core MathJax method MathJax.typesetPromise() is built to take an array of elements. It will then intelligently find all the math within those specific elements and render it, ignoring the rest of the page. This is far more performant than re-rendering the entire document.

> This will be the third MathJax individual update in my app, so I ought to look into a single update with an array of the three elements in question, and then easy to add others if required. If efficiency was needed, I guess I could prescan for \$...\$ or \$\$...\$\$ sequences with regex and create a dynamic list for mathJaxUpdate

That's an excellent approach for efficiency and maintainability. You're thinking about scalability, which is key for a robust application.

You are correct that it's far more efficient to make a single call to mathJaxUpdate with an array of all the elements that need rendering, rather than three separate calls. Pre-scanning the content with a regular expression is a smart way to dynamically build that array.

Here's how you can implement that improved process.

## The typesetAllMathElements Function

You can create a new, all-encompassing function that finds all the elements on the page that contain MathJax syntax and then calls your existing mathJaxUpdate function on them. This method is the most robust and flexible.

```JavaScript

/\*\*

- Scans a container element for any child elements containing MathJax syntax

- and then triggers MathJax to typeset only those elements.

- @param {HTMLElement} containerElement - The parent element to scan for math content.
  _/
  function typesetAllMathElements(containerElement) {
  // A regular expression to find elements containing MathJax syntax.
  // It looks for either inline ($...$) or display ($$...$$) delimiters.
  const mathRegex = /[$]{1,2}._?[$]{1,2}/;

    // A list to hold all the elements we find that contain math.
    const elementsToTypeset = [];

    // Recursively check all child nodes for math content.
    // Using a tree walker is more efficient than `querySelectorAll` for large DOMs.
    const walker = document.createTreeWalker(

         containerElement,
         NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT,
         {
             acceptNode: (node) => {
                 // Check if the element's text content matches the regex.
                 if (node.textContent.match(mathRegex)) {
                     return NodeFilter.FILTER_ACCEPT;
                 }
                 return NodeFilter.FILTER_SKIP;
             },
         },
         false

    );

    // Loop through all found elements and add them to our array.
    let node;
    while ((node = walker.nextNode())) {

         elementsToTypeset.push(node);

    }

    // Call your existing update function with the list of found elements.
    mathJaxUpdate(elementsToTypeset);
    }
```

## How to Integrate It into Your App

Instead of calling mathJaxUpdate on div1, div2, and div3 individually, you would wrap those elements in a single container (e.g., <div id="quiz-content">).

Inject all the new content: Add div1, div2, and div3 into your main container element.

Make a single function call: Call the new typesetAllMathElements function on the container.

```JavaScript

// Example of your dynamic content generation
const quizContentDiv = document.getElementById('quiz-content');

// ...your code to generate and append div1, div2, and div3...
// e.g.,
// quizContentDiv.appendChild(div1);
// quizContentDiv.appendChild(div2);
// quizContentDiv.appendChild(div3);

// Instead of three separate calls, make one efficient call.
typesetAllMathElements(quizContentDiv);
```

This single call will handle everything, automatically finding all the math within the quiz content container and updating it. This pattern is ideal because you can add more math-containing elements to the container in the future without changing your update logic. It's a "set and forget" solution.
