| 3m.1 | Understand that to fully capture the information contained in the amplitude and phase of the signal that the position of the phasors must be resolved as the values on two axes at right angles.                                                                                                                  |

| 6b.1 | Recall that items containing radio communication facilities such as cordless and mobile telephones and information technology communication equipment may produce sufficiently strong signals to cause short range interference but are otherwise generally satisfactory.                                           |
| 6b.1 | Recall that imported devices and toys may not be compliant with the relevant regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6b.2 | Understand that Blocking (or desensitisation) is an effect in a radio receiver where a strong, constant level interfering signal e.g. FM, either swamps the wanted signal or drives the affected circuits out of their normal operating range such that the received audio or data is severely attenuated or muted. |
| 6b.2 | Understand that Cross-modulation is an effect in a radio receiver where the interfering signal is varying in strength e.g.AM or SSB such that the modulation on the interfering signal is added to the modulation on the wanted signal such that both may be heard with varying clarity.                            |
| 6b.3 | Recall that passive intermodulation products can be caused by corrosion in any metallic junctions in metalwork, including transmitting and receiving antennas, supports and guttering.                                                                                                                              |

| 9b.1 | Use the equations for decibel power, dB, dBW, dBm and voltage ratios dBV.                                                                                                                                     |
| 9c.1 | Recall that temperature has an effect on the value of components. Those with negative coefficients will reduce in value as temperature rises whereas those with positive coefficients will increase in value. |
| 9c.1 | Understand the effect this will have on tuned circuits and remedial measures. Questions may include simple calculations.                                                                                      |
