Absolutely, Nigel — that’s a perfect use case for Docker! 🧠💡 You can wrap your HTML/CSS/JS quiz app inside a Docker container that serves it through a lightweight web server. This means you (or anyone else) could run it on any machine without needing to set up anything — just plug and play.

### 🛠️ Basic Setup for Your Web App

Here’s a step-by-step guide using **Nginx**, a super-efficient web server:

#### 1. 🗂️ Folder Structure

Create a directory like this:

```
quiz-app/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── Dockerfile
```

#### 2. 📦 Dockerfile

Create this `Dockerfile` inside the `quiz-app` folder:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Nginx image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove default Nginx web files
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy your app into Nginx's web directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### 3. 🚀 Build Your Image

In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker build -t quiz-app .
```

#### 4. 🎮 Run Your Container

Launch the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 quiz-app
```

May need to change the 8080 port number if there are error messages about it already being in use.

Now go to `http://localhost:8080` — your quiz app will be live in your browser!

### 🎯 Why This Is Awesome

- No installations — it runs _exactly the same_ everywhere.
- You can share the image with teammates or host it in the cloud.
- It’s a perfect starter project to learn Docker in action.

Want to take it a step further and add scoring with a backend, or deploy it to a hosting service like Render or Fly.io? I’d be thrilled to help build that out with you.
