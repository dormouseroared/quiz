That would also apply to option A since the capacitor is initially discharged, the current would jump up to V/R and tail off as the capacitor charges. That leaves B as the only remaining option.

Feedibg binary data to the microphone socket fails for two reasons. The voltage levels are likely to be much higher than the few millivolts expected, and microphones are analogue not digital. That rules oout options A and D. Feeding two audio tones into the microphone socket on FM is a good system in common use, but FM has multiple sidebands, not as described in the stem. Feeding an audio tone into an SSB transmitter will give a single RF signal offset from the notional carrier by the audio frequency, so using two audio tones 170kHz apart will have an identical RF output.

That can mean the response is closer matched to the frequenbcy occupancy of a wanted signal, without affecting the rejection of nearby unwanted signals.",

Option C, regarding image response, is also irrelevant. Options A and B appear plausible, but B is discouraged, saying the filter is good. Can A be the answer? Yes. Phase noise, the small random phase variations  of the local oscillator, cause noise sidebands on the otherwise clean oscillator signal. The RF test signal is intended to mix with the  LO to produce the IF. However, it can also mix with the spurious noise sidebands of the LO, meaning it is present in the IF over the width of those noise sidebands, even if the test signal was absolutely perfect. In good, low noise receivers the phase noise can be a limiting factor in receiver(or transmitter) performance.",

The phase changes much more rapidly than the amplitude response, so is sensitive to the comparitively small frequency changes of narrow band FM. Slope detection will work, provided the slope of the side of a tuned circuit response is reasonably linear, but is markedly less sensitive. It can only really be considered an option when the receiver has a diode detector (for AM) but no purpose designed FM capability. It is also only usable on strong signals due to its insensitivity. There are other methods, for example, using a phase lock loop, perhaps more common for data demodulation, but these are outside the syllabus.",

        explanation: "The critical frequency, the optimum working frequency and the MUF are all related. The critical frequency is the maximum frequency returned on a vertical path, the MUF is the maximum returned on a particular path, and the optimum is around 10-15% below the MUF. All of those relate to the F1 and F2 layers. The LUF is set by absorption in the D layer. Particularly on a long path involving multiple hops in different time zones, the LUF can be above the MUF when no ionospheric communication is possible over the path concerned. If communication is possible, it follows that the LUF is below the MUF and optimum frequencies.",
