Because it is so much larger than the resistor it is in parallel with, it has very little impact on total R; it is worth remembering that the bigger the difference is between parallel resistors, the less it will change the overall value.

        explanation: `There are a few stages to go through to get the answer. First of all we need to work out RTotal, then use Ohm’s Law to work out the current. So, the first step with the resistor combination is to work out the combined resistance of the parallel element formed by R2 & R3. Our ‘rule of thumb’ tells us it will be less than 220Ω. The 1MΩ actually has little effect and the combination comes out at 219.95Ω (see key stokes below). We can add 220Ω to the 1kΩ, so make RTotal = 1220Ω. Now Ohm’s Law says V= IR and so I = V/R = 12/1220 = 0.0098A, which rounds up to 0.01A = 10mA. Because R1 is in series with the battery, all of the current flowing in the circuit will pass through R1.

R is not so straightforward; we have five series pairs all wired in parallel. As with all these kinds of questions we must work out the equivalent values to get them all into either a series, or a parallel circuit. In this case we can easily work out that each series pair gives 820 + 180 = 1000Ω. So, we have the equivalent of five 1kΩ resistors in parallel. With five resistors of the same value we simply divide the value by the number of resistors = 1000/5 = 200Ω. We can now work out the power using 100V RMS and 200Ω: $$P=\\frac{V^2}{R} = \\frac{100^2}{200} = 50W$$`,

Plate separation distance ‘d’ is on the bottom line, so any increase in plate separation will reduce the capacitance, ruling out ‘a’ and ‘b’.
