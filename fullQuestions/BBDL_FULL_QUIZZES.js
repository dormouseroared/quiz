When in another country, you must abide by that country’s Licence Conditions, so the Ofcom documents in ‘b’ are irrelevant. ‘d’ is wrong because you must use the country prefix quoted in T/R 61-01 following by your UK callsign. This particular Licence Condition is in paragraph 3 on page 2 of the 1-page Licence document issued by Ofcom, which is not included in EX309.

Because it is so much larger than the resistor it is in parallel with, it has very little impact on total R; it is worth remembering that the bigger the difference is between parallel resistors, the less it will change the overall value.

    explanation: `The first thing to note here is that there are two parallel networks, each made up from five 125Ω resistors, and they are wired in series. So, we need to find out RTotal for each of the parallel sections, and then add them together. With the resistors all being the same value, we can simply divide the value, 125Ω, by the number of resistors, 5, so each one of the parallel groups has an RTotal of 125/5 = 25Ω.

    options: ["10mA", "100mA", "10A", "100A"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `There are a few stages to go through to get the answer. First of all we need to work out $R_{Total}$, then use Ohm’s Law to work out the current. So, the first step with the resistor combination is to work out the combined resistance of the parallel element formed by R2 & R3. Our ‘rule of thumb’ tells us it will be less than 220Ω. The 1MΩ actually has little effect and the combination comes out at 219.95Ω (see key stokes below). We can add 220Ω to the 1kΩ, so make $R_{Total}$ = 1220Ω. Now Ohm’s Law says V= IR and so I = V/R = 12/1220 = 0.0098A, which rounds up to 0.01A = 10mA. Because R1 is in series with the battery, all of the current flowing in the circuit will pass through R1.

    options: ["10W", "20W", "50W", "100W"],

    explanation: `The main formula to use here is P=V2/R. We are given V, and because it is an RMS value, we can use it without any further work. R is not so straightforward; we have five series pairs all wired in parallel. As with all these kinds of questions we must work out the equivalent values to get them all into either a series, or a parallel circuit. In this case we can easily work out that each series pair gives 820 + 180 = 1000Ω. So, we have the equivalent of five 1kΩ resistors in parallel. With five resistors of the same value we simply divide the value by the number of resistors = 1000/5 = 200Ω. We can now work out the power using 100V RMS and 200Ω: $$P=\\frac{V^2}{R} = \\frac{100^2}{200} = 50W$$`,

Because theyare the same resistance, the potential difference (voltage) will be the same across both. We are told there is 50V across R3 so the supply voltage must be twice that = 100V. That rules out ‘c’ and ‘d’. Next step; we can see that R1 is in parallel with the potential divider formed by R2 and R3 (redraw it with both R2 and R3 vertical if you cannot see that). So, we have the equivalent of two 100Ω resistors in parallel. That means the total resistance is 50Ω. Final step is to work out the current through the ammeter. Armed with the knowledge that V = 100V and R = 50Ω, we can use good old Ohm’s law to work out I = V/R = 2A, showing ‘b’ to be the correct answer.`,

This can have major effects on the performance of the equipment. Although ‘a’, ’b’, and ’d’ might, in part, be correct, the important aspect here is that thorough testing will be required to confirm the correct performance of the equipment. `,

    explanation: `A ‘classic’ isolating transformer consists of two inductors wound on a common former. Because they share the same former, the magnetic field generated by one, induces a current in the other. They are therefore magnetically coupled and are said to exhibit ‘mutual inductance’. ‘a’ is wrong because whilst energy can be transferred by stay capacitance, that is not reliable and is not used in transformers. ‘c’ is wrong because whilst each winding of a transformer will exhibit inductive reactance, that is not the property that allows the transformer action to take place. ‘d’ is wrong because capacitive reactance has little to do with the operation of a transformer.`,

Capacitors can block DC for sure, but ‘d’ would only be correct if C3 were in series with R4 but it is in parallel, so DC will flow through the resistor, making ‘d’ wrong.

    correct: 3,
    explanation: `‘d’ is the correct answer. FM Bandwidth (BW) is determined by the maximum Audio Frequency and the peak deviation, so ‘a’ will have no effect on the bandwidth of the FM transmission, neither will ‘b’ (reducing harmonics), or ‘c’ (a mic with an AF response greater than 3kHz has potential for increasing the bandwidth of the audio frequency signals). That must mean ‘d’ is the correct answer. Why? Because less AF amplitude will mean less deviation, so less BW, hopefully sufficient to ensure that the modulation does not achieve the peak deviation. `,

    correct: 0,
    explanation: `Remember the steps in generating a single sideband signal using the traditional method. A carrier is first generated, this is passed through a balanced mixer together with the audio signal. The mixer creates two amplitude modulated sidebands, one above and one below the carrier frequency. The carrier is also “nulled out” by means of the balancing action of the device. We now have a Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier signal. This is what enters the circuit from the left side. Next, wehave transistor amplifier. Then the four quartz crystals (the subject of the question) and three capacitors to ground. This is a classic ladder crystal filter circuit. It has a bandwidth of perhaps 3kHz and will only allow one sideband to pass. This is followed with another transistor amplifier to add some gain and match the filter impedance to the following circuits. Aide memoir: One crystal and a transistor is probably an oscillator. More than one crystal with more than one capacitor is probably a filter. `,

average power. ‘a’ is therefore the correct answer. It is worth noting that the concept of power amplifiers working more or less,

includes 21MHz, which is what you are trying to achieve (15m = 21MHz) so it is not an unwanted

change a frequency to itself), so ‘a’ is incorrect. Having IFs on harmonically related frequencies would be
unwise as unwanted mixer products could be on the IFs, so ‘b’ is wrong. Normal practice is to have a high
1st IF to push the image frequency as far away from the wanted frequency as possible, which makes ‘c’
look good and rules out ‘d’. The only credible answer is therefore ‘c’ and the second part of the answer,

    image: "",
    options: ["85dB", "95dB", "105dB", "950dB"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: `On 3.5MHz the external noise is generally quite high. By adding 10dB gain to
the receiver, the noise level will be amplified by 10dB and strong signals will still distort once they reach
the same level as they would without the amplifier. That means the effective dynamic range of the
combined system is 10dB less than it was without the external pre-amp. If there were no noise, as is
often the case on 28MHz and VHF/UHF, the dynamic range would be unchanged, weaker signals would
be heard with a 10dB gain. Strong signals would still distort at lower signal levels than without the
amplifier, but the 95dB range would be retained. Remember that the basic dynamic range of a receiver
cannot really be improved upon, it can only be made worse.`,

    correct: 1,
    explanation: `‘a’ and ‘d’ may cause distorted signals to be transmitted, but no sideband
inversion will occur through stages being overdriven. So is it modulated signal from oscillator or
oscillator from modulated? If in doubt try an example for yourself; USB signal 14.0 to 14.003MHz, take
that from an oscillator on 20MHz and IF will run 6.0 to 5.997MHz (now looks like LSB). Same 14MHz USB
signal with a 5MHz oscillator; subtracting 5MHz from 14MHz USB gives 9.0 to 9.003MHz (still USB). So

the dynamic range of the receiver, so ‘a’ is not true. They can increase noise levels, but they will never
reduce noise levels, so ‘b’ is not true. A good quality RF amp in a low noise environment can improve
weak signal reception, noting that distortion will still occur earlier with moderate to strong signals, so ‘c’
looks to be a feasible answer. With the potential to increase noise and with signals distorting at a lower
level, ‘d’ cannot always be true. ‘c’ is therefore the ’most correct’ answer.`,
