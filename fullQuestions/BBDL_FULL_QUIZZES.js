Hopefully you remembered that series resistors simply add together to give the total resistance, RTotal.

Because it is so much larger than the resistor it is in parallel with, it has very little impact on total R; it is worth remembering that the bigger the difference is between parallel resistors, the less it will change the overall value.

For the same to be true in the top potential divider, the gap resistor needs to be half of the 100Ω resistor, i.e. 50Ω.
