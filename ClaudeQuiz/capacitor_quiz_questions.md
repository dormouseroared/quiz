# Capacitor Quiz Questions - Full License Practice

## Question 1
What is the reactance of a 100pF capacitor at 14MHz?

A) 114 ohms
B) 228 ohms  
C) 456 ohms
D) 912 ohms

**Answer: A) 114 ohms**
*Calculation: Xc = 1/(2πfC) = 1/(2π × 14×10⁶ × 100×10⁻¹²) = 114Ω*

## Question 2
Two 470μF capacitors are connected in series. What is the total capacitance?

A) 940μF
B) 470μF
C) 235μF
D) 117.5μF

**Answer: C) 235μF**
*Series capacitors: 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2, so Ctotal = 470/2 = 235μF*

## Question 3
What happens to the energy stored in a capacitor if the voltage across it is doubled?

A) Energy stays the same
B) Energy doubles
C) Energy increases by a factor of 4
D) Energy halves

**Answer: C) Energy increases by a factor of 4**
*Energy = ½CV². If V doubles, energy increases by 2² = 4 times*

## Question 4
A 1000μF capacitor is charged to 12V through a 10kΩ resistor. What is the time constant?

A) 1 second
B) 10 seconds
C) 100 seconds
D) 0.1 seconds

**Answer: B) 10 seconds**
*Time constant τ = RC = 10×10³ × 1000×10⁻⁶ = 10 seconds*

## Question 5
Which type of capacitor is most suitable for high-frequency RF applications?

A) Electrolytic
B) Tantalum
C) Ceramic
D) Paper

**Answer: C) Ceramic**
*Ceramic capacitors have low ESR and good high-frequency characteristics*

## Question 6
What is the voltage rating requirement for two 25V capacitors connected in series across a 40V supply?

A) Each capacitor must be rated at least 20V
B) Each capacitor must be rated at least 25V
C) Each capacitor must be rated at least 40V
D) The voltage divides equally, so 25V rating is adequate

**Answer: C) Each capacitor must be rated at least 40V**
*In practice, voltage may not divide equally due to leakage differences, so each should handle the full supply voltage*

## Question 7
What is the phase relationship between voltage and current in a pure capacitive circuit?

A) Voltage leads current by 90°
B) Current leads voltage by 90°
C) Voltage and current are in phase
D) Voltage lags current by 45°

**Answer: B) Current leads voltage by 90°**
*In capacitive circuits, current leads voltage by 90° (or voltage lags current by 90°)*

## Question 8
A variable capacitor has a range of 50pF to 500pF. What is the frequency tuning range when used with a 10μH inductor?

A) 2.25MHz to 7.1MHz
B) 7.1MHz to 22.5MHz
C) 22.5MHz to 71MHz
D) 0.71MHz to 2.25MHz

**Answer: A) 2.25MHz to 7.1MHz**
*f = 1/(2π√LC). With max C: f = 2.25MHz, with min C: f = 7.1MHz*
